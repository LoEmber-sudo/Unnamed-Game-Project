I started coding this game with 0 C++ knowlage, but now I think im not bad at it.

If you want to try out the game there is an exe in the Release folder OR use Cmake or visual studio or g++ to compile the project.

The whole game was made in one .cpp file (main.cpp) i hope it hurts, its very bad i know.
